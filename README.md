# Generate Repository README.md File

The README.md file is extremely important because it introduces and explains your projects. It contains vital information to understand what the project is about. It should answer most of the audience's questions about how to use the repository and collaborate.

The README.md is traditionally written in uppercase characters, so it is more prominent. Althought, it is not mandatory to be uppercase.

The README.md file should be the first file you create in a new project. It should be populated with information every time you update the project. It should be also the last file to finish, in order to show the finish product of your project with an animated gif or a screenshot of your deployed web app.

The README.md file should be placed in the top level directory of the project. Code hosting services such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) will look for the README.md file and display it along with the list of files and directories in your project.

The README.md file can be written in any text file format, but the most common is __markdown__ because it allows to add some lightweight formatting.

### Suggestions for a good README.md file

Every project is different and some suggestions may not apply to the project. It is always better to have a too long and detailed README.md file than a too short one. Suggestions:

* __Project Name__: a self-explaining name for the project.
* __Project Description__: a good description of the project, describing what the project can do for the user.
* __Links__: add links to any reference that might be unfamiliar to the visitors. 
* __Features__. 
* __Project Alternatives__.
* __Badges__: these are small images with metadata. They can indicate multiple things, like which tests passed for the project. We used [Shields](https://shields.io/) to add some badges. 
* __Screenshots, Gifs, or Videos__: it is a good idea to include screenshots, animated gifs or videos. We used [ttygif](https://github.com/icholy/ttygif) for the animated gifs.
* __Requirements__: include all necessary information if the project only runs in a specific context (Ex: ES6, MacOS X) or has dependencies that have to be installed manually.
* __Installation Instructions__: consider that whoever is reading the readme.md file is a novice and need assistance with the installation. List each step in the installation process to remove any ambiguity and make things easier for the user. 
* __Usage__: provide a lot of examples to the user and show the expected output. Provide links to the examples if they are too long to include in the Readme.md file.
* __Support__: where can the users go for help?. You can provide an issue tracker, a chat room, or an email address.
* __Future Development__: provide ideas for future releases.
* __Contributions__: are you open to contributions? What are the requirements to accept contributions?.
* __Documentation__: provide any documentation to developers that want to use your project and make changes. Document commands to lint the code. Have instructions to run tests in a server or in a browser.
* __Authors__: list your contributions or your collaborator's contributions.
* __Acknowledgment__: show appreciation for people that have contributed to the project.
* __License__: for open source projects, say how it is licensed.
* __Project Status__: add a note at the top of the Readme.md file about the development status of the project.
